# SaaS Platform API and Database Design

## I. Introduction

This document outlines the API and database design for a comprehensive SaaS platform. The platform includes features such as user authentication, organization management, payments, messaging, and various user-centric functionalities.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: [Your chosen backend framework, e.g., FastAPI, Django, Node.js]
- Database: [Your chosen database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL]
- API Documentation: OpenAPI 3.0.0

## II. API Design

Our API is designed using OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to interact with various features of the SaaS platform.

### Key Endpoints:

1. Authentication
   - POST /auth/signup
   - POST /auth/login
   - POST /auth/social-login/{provider}
   - POST /auth/magic-link
   - POST /auth/reset-password

2. User Management
   - GET /users
   - POST /users
   - GET /users/{userId}
   - PUT /users/{userId}
   - DELETE /users/{userId}

3. Organization Management
   - GET /organizations
   - POST /organizations
   - GET /organizations/{orgId}
   - PUT /organizations/{orgId}
   - DELETE /organizations/{orgId}

4. Payments
   - POST /payments/stripe
   - POST /payments/flutterwave
   - POST /payments/lemonsqueezy

5. Messaging
   - POST /messages/email
   - GET /messages/templates
   - POST /messages/templates

## III. Database Design

Our database is designed to support all the features of the SaaS platform efficiently. It includes tables for users, organizations, roles, payments, content management, and more.

### Key Tables:

1. users
2. organizations
3. user_org
4. roles
5. user_role
6. social_accounts
7. payments
8. email_templates
9. user_settings
10. content_pages
11. invites
12. user_data
13. waitlist_entries
14. notifications
15. blog_posts
16. activity_logs
